/*

In this implementation, we use the sync.Mutex type to provide mutual exclusion and ensure that only 
one goroutine can hold the lock at a time. The NewDistributedLock function initializes a new instance 
of the DistributedLock struct with the isLocked flag set to false. The Acquire method acquires the 
lock by calling Lock on the mutex, setting the isLocked flag to true. The Release method releases the 
lock by calling Unlock on the mutex, setting the isLocked flag to false if the lock was held.


This implementation is not distributed, but it provides a basic example of using mutual exclusion to 
implement a lock in a multi-threaded program. If you need to implement a distributed lock, you can 
combine this approach with a distributed consensus algorithm, such as Paxos or Raft, to ensure that 
the lock is consistently acquired and released across multiple nodes in a distributed system.
